# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

**Overview**

This project implements a machine learning model to predict real estate prices using Linear Regression with k-fold cross-validation. The model achieves 82% accuracy through careful data preprocessing, outlier removal, and feature engineering.

**Dataset**
The project uses a CSV file containing real estate data with various features that influence property prices.

**Features may include:**
Property size
Location
Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
Age of property
Additional amenities
And other relevant characteristics
